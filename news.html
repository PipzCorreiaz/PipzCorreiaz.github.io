												<h2 class="title">I am at IROS'18</h2>
											</header>
											<section>
												<p>I am currently writting this post from Madrid, where I have been for the past four days attending the IROS conference. The full paper that brought me here is "The Power of a Hand-shake in Human-Robot Interactions". This project started at the Social Robotics course of Prof. Ana Paiva (while I was doing T.A.) by a group of MSc students, João Catarino and Pedro Ribeiro. The students used the handshake developed by João Avelino to conduct a user study. My support was crucial to carefully choose an adequate experimental design, conduct the statistical analysis and refine the discussion of the results. Overall, Prof. Ana Paiva and I are extremely happy with the ideas of our MSc students and the collaborations we have been establishing on this course.</p>
												<img style="width:400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="images/iros18.JPG" alt="" />
												<p>For this paper, we have collaborated with <a href="http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">ISR</a> lab, led by Prof. José Santos-Vitor, and more especifically João Avelino, Plinio Moreno and Prof. Alexandre Bernardino from the <a href="http://vislab.isr.ist.utl.pt/">VisLab</a> research group. On this photo, from the left to the right, there is Alexandre Bernardino, me, João Avelino, José Santos-Vitor, and Plinio Moreno. Moreover, on this user study we have used the Vizzy robot (created at the ISR lab), which is btw a super cute robot with an outstanding gazing system. Look at us!</p>

											<section>
												<p>This year edition of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems conference was in Stockholm, Sweden. I presented my full paper "Exploring the Impact of Fault Justification in Human-Robot Trust" which reveals the results of a user study me and Carla Guerra conducted for the Social Robots and Human-Robot Interaction course. It was the first time I have designed by myself the experimental design and methodology of a user study and, as you can imagine, I learned a lot...</p>
												<p>The conference itself was great but huge, too many sessions in parallel. Speacially because this year IFAAMAS organized an AI meeting with the joint conferences IJCAI/ECAI, ICML, ICCBR and SoCS. Nonetheless, the keynote speakers were really really REALLY good: Thomas Henzinger, Ana Paiva (my supervisor!), Joyce Yue Chai and Josh Tenenbaum.</p>
												<img style="width:400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="images/aamas18.jpg" alt="" />
												<p>Besides all that, my lab had a strong presence this year and, as usual, we met some of our fomer members. In the photo you can seen, from left to right, top to bottom: Ana Paiva, Rui Prada, Fernando Santos, me, Iolanda Leite (with her little baby), Brian Ravenet, Joana Campos, Francisco Melo, Diogo Rato, Alexis Jacq and Rui's son.</p>

												<p>The 1st edition of the International Summer School on Artificial Intelligence and Games was held in Chania, Crete, Greece. The organizers Georgios N. Yannakakis and Julian Togelius decided to create this annual venue after publishing their book on AI and Games. The amazing invited speakers were Matteo Hessel, África Periáñez, Alessandro Canossa, Emily Short, Arthur Juliani, Olivier Delalleau and (my favorite) Christoffer Holmgård.</p>
												<img style="width:400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="images/chania2.jpg" alt="" />
												<p>During the last two days we could also attend the Game Jam. Me, Diogo Rato (from my lab), Leonid Berov (friend from AIIDE'17) and Oleksiy Solyanyk tried to create a bot to play "Bots Against Humanity".</p>

											</header>
											<section>
												<p>I went for the very first time to the International Conference on Human Robot Interaction that was in Chicago, IL, USA. My goal was to present the full paper "Group-based Emotions in Teams of Humans and Robots", which was the result of a project for the course of Affect Computing. The extraordinary collaboration with Samuel Mascarenhas and Rui Prada helped me to introduce a new manipulation of group-based emotions on my card game scenario. The promising role of this type of emotions in HRI was shown in our user study and consequent results.</p>

												<p>I went to the 3rd edition of the Summer School on Social Human-Robot Interaction in Vila Nova de Milfontes, Portugal. During this amazing week, I had the opportunity to meet many PhD students in my field of research but with several distinct backgrounds. Also, there was an unexpectedly wonderful workshop about Pitch and Presentation, taught by Margarida Antues, which gave me a new perspective on how to present in a very natural and relaxed way.</p>

												<p>This year edition of the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) in MIT, Cambridge, USA. I am going to present the full paper "Groups of humans and robots: Understanding membership preferences and team formation". This paper presents people's prefrences when partnering a robot to play the Sueca card game. The technical work was again a followup in the Sueca project, where we have put two robots autonomously playing the game with two people in a 1 hour long interaction!!! I am also particularly proud of this work due to the clean experimental design. Me, Sofia Petisca and Patrícia Alves-Oliveira took many hours discussion all the possible combinations for doing it.</p>
												<p>The conference is so far the best I have been to, especially in terms of organization. Although there was a record od attendees (around 1000), I am glad they keep doing it in a single track version.</p>

											</header>
											<section>
												<p>I finally denfended my MSc thesis, the title of which being "EMYS: a social robot that plays Sueca". Sueca is a Portuguese card game, similar to (English) Whist, (German) Skat, or (Italian) Briscola. Apparently, my supervisor Prof. Ana Paiva used to play it a lot in her childhood with her grandfather, which motivated her to suggest this project of creating a robot that could socially play this game. Curiously, this was also the card game I have played the most and, therefore, I could not have missed this challenge.</p>
												<p>Sueca is played by four players and has the particular and interesting property of being a team game. As a result, this scenario allows the exploration of cooperative and competitive features of the human-robot interaction. Among the technical challenges, I had to develop the AI to "solve" this imperfect information game and the robotic agent that would accommodate it in a sociable and natural way.</p>
												<p>This was a long journey, but I am very proud and happy with the end of this chapter. Hopefully it may be fruitful in the future...</p>
