												<p>I was a <b>Program Chair</b> for the <b>HRI Pioneers Workshop</b>, together with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_o5hb30AAAAJ" target="_blank">Bob Schadenberg</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kx6BthoAAAAJ" target="_blank">Aaquib Tabrez</a>, and <a href="http://djrea.ca/" target="_blank">Daniel Rea</a>.</p>
												<p>It was my first time as program chair of something. I know it is just a small workshop... But if it was as important for the current applicants as it was for me last year (and the year before), I wanted to do a good job. I particularly enjoyed picking the reviewers for each submission and I was extremely happy when I realised that most reviews were great (full of constructive feedback!). The saddest part is definitely the decision as it may be unfair for some submissions... I did our best! I really enjoyed this experience.</p>

											</header>
											<section>
												<p>The semester is about to finish and so is our second edition of the <a target="_blank" href="https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/hri-reading-group/">HRI Reading Group</a>. I have been helping <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kimbaraka.com/">Kim Baraka</a> organizing these sessions for the past two semesters. All the papers were great but some of my favourites were: "Communication: The context of change" (Barnlund, D.C., 2011) or "Usability evaluation considered harmful" (Greenberg, S. and Buxton, B., 2008).</p>
												<p>Our sessions go beyond presenting the papers as they try to extrapolate meaning to other fields, or even discuss further applications. The goal is to understand better what Human-Robot Interaction was, currently is, and how it can evolve in the future.</p>
												<img style="width:400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="images/news/reading-group.jpeg" alt="" />
												<p>It has been an incredible experience and I honestly feel I grew up as a researcher. Most of the insightful discussions forced me to view different perspectives that are not so obvious when reading a paper in a straightforward manner. Obviously, this was not possible without the brilliant mind of (my dear friend and) my colleague <strong>Kim</strong>.</p>

											<section>
												<p>I have just attended the <strong>Symposium on Interdisciplinary Insights into Group Dynamics</strong> in Delft, The Netherlands. As the name of the symposium says, the goal was to bring together interdisciplinary fields. In this case, computer scientists, informally called "The Geeks", and researchers from social sciences, informally called "The Groupies". Attendees were asked to mark their badges with either a blue dot (geek) or a red dot (groupie). The following photo shows me and <a target="_blank" href="https://patricialvesoliveira.com/">Patrícia</a>, both happy to belong to these two worlds!</p>
												<img style="width:400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="images/news/geeksngroupies.png" alt="" />
												<p>The organization of the symposium was great, thanks to Hayley Hung, Nale Lehmann-Willenbrock, Zeena Harakeh, Josette Gevers, and Dirk Heylen. The amazing keynote speakers were Steve Kozlowski, Jean-Marc Odobez, Michaela Kolbe, Matthew Cronin, and Hatice Gunes. My personal goals of attending this symposium were totally met: to understand some of the challenges of Group Dynamics, and to meet leading researchers working on the field, to acquire guidelines for my future research.</p>

												<h2 class="title">Paper presented at ASSETS'18</h2>
											</header>
											<section>
												<p>One of my most recent papers is "What My Eyes Can't See, A Robot Can Show Me: Exploring the Collaboration Between Blind People and Robots", which has been presented at ASSETS conference in Galway, Ireland. The paper was presented by <a target="_blank" href="https://tjvguerreiro.github.io/">Prof. Tiago Guerreiro</a>, who I had the great pleasure to meet and work with. This project was born at the Social Robotics course by the idea and motivation of the students Mayara Bonani and Michał Ostapowicz. Prof. Tiago Guerreiro and his current PhD student <a target="_blank" href="https://andrefprodrigues.github.io/">André Rodrigues</a> were invited to collaborate on this project due to their knowledge and expertise on the accessibility literature, in particular related to blind people. Their dedication was undoubtedly crucial for the success of this work (thank you both once more!). Briefly, the paper reports the results of two user studies: (1) a set of focus groups to understand perceptions and expectations of robots; and (2) user study where Baxter provided assistance in an assembly task — a Tangram puzzle.</p>
												<img style="width:400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="images/news/assets2018.png" alt="" />
												<p>Additionally, I would like to add a quick note on how insightful it was for me as the first interaction with blind people. For instance, I have learned simple but commonly (and unfortunately) unknown guidelines on how to physically guide a blind person walking.</p>
												<p>We will hopefully have more news about this project soon... ;)</p>

This project started at the Social Robotics course of Prof. Ana Paiva (while I was doing T.A.) by a group of MSc students, João Catarino and Pedro Ribeiro. The students used the handshake developed by João Avelino to conduct a user study. My support was crucial to carefully choose an adequate experimental design, conduct the statistical analysis and refine the discussion of the results. Overall, Prof. Ana Paiva and I are extremely happy with the ideas of our MSc students and the collaborations we have been establishing on this course.</p>

												<p>For this paper, we have collaborated with <a target="_blank" href="http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">ISR</a> lab, led by Prof. José Santos-Vitor, and more specifically João Avelino, Plinio Moreno and Prof. Alexandre Bernardino from the <a target="_blank" href="http://vislab.isr.ist.utl.pt/">VisLab</a> research group. On this photo, from the left to the right, there is Alexandre Bernardino, me, João Avelino, José Santos-Vitor, and Plinio Moreno. Moreover, on this user study, we have used the Vizzy robot (created at the ISR lab), which is btw a super cute robot with an outstanding gazing system. Look at us!</p>

											<section>
												<p>This year edition of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems conference was in Stockholm, Sweden. I presented my full paper "Exploring the Impact of Fault Justification in Human-Robot Trust" which reveals the results of a user study me and Carla Guerra conducted for the Social Robots and Human-Robot Interaction course. It was the first time I have designed by myself the experimental design and methodology of a user study and, as you can imagine, I learned a lot...</p>
												<p>The conference itself was great but huge, too many sessions in parallel. Especially because this year IFAAMAS organized an AI meeting with the joint conferences IJCAI/ECAI, ICML, ICCBR and SoCS. Nonetheless, the keynote speakers were really really REALLY good: Thomas Henzinger, Ana Paiva (my supervisor!), Joyce Yue Chai and Josh Tenenbaum.</p>

												<p>Besides all that, my lab had a strong presence this year and, as usual, we met some of our former members. In the photo you can see, from left to right, top to bottom: Ana Paiva, Rui Prada, Fernando Santos, me, Iolanda Leite (with her little baby), Brian Ravenet, Joana Campos, Francisco Melo, Diogo Rato, Alexis Jacq and Rui's son.</p>

												<p>I went for the very first time to the International Conference on Human Robot Interaction that was in Chicago, IL, USA. My goal was to present the full paper "Group-based Emotions in Teams of Humans and Robots", which was the result of a project for the course of Affect Computing. The extraordinary collaboration with Samuel Mascarenhas and Rui Prada helped me to introduce a new manipulation of group-based emotions on my card game scenario. The promising role of this type of emotions in HRI was shown in our user study and consequent results.</p>

												<p>This year edition of the Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment conference was in Snowbird, UT, USA. I am going to present the full paper "A Social Robot as a Card Game Player". This paper is focused on the development of the card game player and the algorithms it uses. During the conference, I attended to amazing talks and keynotes and my favourite was Mary Lou Maher. Furthermore, I have met Prof. Michael Buro that has also used similar algorithmic approaches in his Skat agent. It was a pleasure to meet him and discuss the bunch of improvements that could still be done.</p>

												<p>This year edition of the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) in MIT, Cambridge, USA. I am going to present the full paper "Groups of humans and robots: Understanding membership preferences and team formation". This paper presents people's prefrences when partnering a robot to play the Sueca card game. The technical work was again a followup in the Sueca project, where we have put two robots autonomously playing the game with two people in a 1-hour long interaction!!! I am also particularly proud of this work due to the clean experimental design. Me, Sofia Petisca and Patrícia Alves-Oliveira took many hours discussing all the possible combinations for doing it.</p>
												<p>The conference is so far the best I have been to, especially in terms of organization. Although there was a record of attendees (around 1000), I am glad they keep doing it in a single track version.</p>

												<h2 class="title">MSc thesis defense</h2>
											</header>
											<section>
												<p>I finally defended my MSc thesis, the title of which being "EMYS: a social robot that plays Sueca". Sueca is a Portuguese card game, similar to (English) Whist, (German) Skat, or (Italian) Briscola. Apparently, my supervisor, Prof. Ana Paiva, used to play it a lot in her childhood with her grandfather, which motivated her to suggest this project of creating a robot that could socially play this game. Curiously, this was also the card game I have played the most and, therefore, I could not have missed this challenge.</p>
												<p>Sueca is played by four players and has a particular and interesting property of being a team game. As a result, this scenario allows the exploration of cooperative and competitive features of the human-robot interaction. Among the technical challenges, I had to develop the AI to "solve" this imperfect information game and the robotic agent that would accommodate it in a sociable and natural way.</p>
												<p>This was a long journey, but I am very proud of the end of this chapter. Hopefully, it may be fruitful in the future...</p>
